# Rock Paper Scissors🪨📄✂️

A simple web-based Rock Paper Scissors game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- Play against a computer that randomly selects a move
- Displays the player's and computer's choices
- Tracks the score for both sides
- Includes a reset button

## How It Works
The game listens for user clicks on one of three buttons (rock, paper, or scissors), generates a random computer choice, and determines the result based on standard game rules. The DOM is updated dynamically to reflect each move and the current score.

## Technologies Used

- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
